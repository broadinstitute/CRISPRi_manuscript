We collected and analyzed Histone ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project for 3 different markers (H3K4me3, H3k27ac, and H3k27me3) in 3 different cell lines (A549, HCT116, and K562). Links to the selected biosamples can be found in this folder. We used bigBed files containing pseudo replicated peaks aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome for all markers and cell lines, and classified guides with cut sites positioned between the ends of at least one peak as overlapping with a peak. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed on the gene level to assess the significance of phenotypic differences displayed by guides within versus outside of peaks.
